# Amazon-Product-Manager
A tool to help high-volume Amazon retailers manage large numbers of items

'PriceListCleanUp.py' takes in a .csv file of different items, with column headings from 'Price list Data Base upload template.csv',  
Then, it cleans and formats the data into a format that can then be used to get listings and offers via the Amazon API.
This data can then be uploaded to a MySQL DB.
